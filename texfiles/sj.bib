Created or imported spatial weights and their eigenvalues are generated as temporary Stata matrices or permanent Mata files. spwmatrix also exports the generated spatial weights to a .dat file for use in Matlab or to a .gwt file for use in GeoDa. When creating spatial weights, spwmatrix uses either the straight-line (crow-fly) Euclidean distance or the Great Circle distance depending on whether the latitudes and longitudes supplied in varlist are projected or not.},

    abstract = { In this article, we introduce the sftt command, which fits two-tier stochastic frontier (2TSF) models with cross-sectional data. Like most frontier models, a 2TSF model consists of a linear frontier model and a composite error term. The error term is assumed to be a mixture of three components: two onesided inefficiency terms—strictly nonnegative and nonpositive, respectively—and a symmetric noise term. When providing appropriate distributional assumptions, sftt can fit models with exponential and half-normal specifications. sftt also fits 2TSF models with the scaling property to mitigate concerns over distributional specifications. In addition, we provide two subcommands, sftt sigs and sftt eff, to assist in postestimation efficiency analysis. We provide an overview of the 2TSF literature, a description of the sftt command and its options, and examples using simulated and actual data. }

    abstract = { In this article, we introduce a new command, sfcount, to fit count-data stochastic frontier models. Although originally designed to estimate production and production-cost functions, this new command can be used to estimate mean regression functions when count data are suspected to be underreported or over-reported. }
