	abstract = {This article describes sfcross and sfpanel, two new Stata commands for the estimation of cross-sectional and panel-data stochastic frontier models. sfcross extends the capabilities of the frontier command by including additional models (Greene, 2003, Journal of Productivity Analysis 19: 179–190; Wang, 2002, Journal of Productivity Analysis 18: 241–253) and command functionalities, such as the possibility of managing complex survey data characteristics. Similarly, sfpanel allows one to fit a much wider range of time-varying inefficiency models compared with the xtfrontier command, including the model of Cornwell, Schmidt, and Sickles (1990, Journal of Econometrics 46: 185–200); the model of Lee and Schmidt (1993, in The Measurement of Productive Efficiency: Techniques and Applications), a production frontier model with flexible temporal variation in technical efficiency; the flexible model of Kumbhakar (1990, Journal of Econometrics 46: 201–211); the inefficiency effects model of Battese and Coelli (1995 Empirical Economics 20: 325–332); and the “true” fixed- and random-effects models of Greene (2005a, Journal of Econometrics 126: 269–303). A brief overview of the stochastic frontier literature, a description of the two commands and their options, and examples using simulated and real data are provided.},

The Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood ({PPML}) and the fixed effect models were also estimated simultaneously to confirm the robustness of our findings. The results reveal that China’s economic size ({GDP}) and its importing countries, the Belt and Road Initiative ({BRI}), common border, and the Chinese language positively determine China’s agricultural export flows. The results, on the other hand, also reveal that China’s agricultural export is adversely influenced by the income (per capita {GDP}) of China and its trade partners, currency depreciation, distance, and landlocked. On an average account, China has untapped the potential of 51\% in its agriculture export with the countries used in this study. We provide policy suggestions as part of our study.},

However, recent uneven developments of both environmental performance and renewable energy technology among regions in China remind us to revisit the above theoretical link. In this paper, we relax the hypothesized homogeneity and linearity in traditional empirical models to investigate the effects of renewable energy technology innovation on China's green productivity. The results of the partially linear functional-coefficient models show that the effect of renewable energy technological innovation on green productivity is significant only when the relative income level of a province passes a critical turning point. Beyond the turning point, such an effect increases with the growth of relative income levels. Finally, we provide provincial specific policy implications based on the estimated nonparametric relationship between renewable energy technology innovation and green productivity.},

The indices are typically estimated using data envelopment analysis ({DEA}) estimators. Malmquist indices are often decomposed into sub-indices that measure the sources of productivity change (e.g., changes in efficiency, technology or other factors). Recently, Kneip et al. (2018) provide new theoretical results enabling inference about productivity change for individual firms as well as average productivity changed measured in terms of geometric means. This paper extends those results to components of productivity change arising from various decompositions of Malmquist indices. New central limit theorems are developed to allow inference about arithmetic means of logarithms of the sub-indices as well as geometric means of (untransformed) sub-indices. The results are quite general and extend to other sub-indices not explicitly considered in this paper.},

While the best practice frontier estimator is biased below the theoretical frontier for a finite sample size, the bias approaches zero for large samples. The {DEA} estimators exhibit the desirable asymptotic property of consistency, and the asymptotic distribution of the {DEA} estimators of inefficiency deviations is identical to the true distribution of these deviations.

	abstract = {In productivity and efficiency analysis, the technical efficiency of a production unit is measured through its distance to the efficient frontier of the production set. The most familiar non-parametric methods use Farrell–Debreu, Shephard, or hyperbolic radial measures. These approaches require that inputs and outputs be non-negative, which can be problematic when using financial data. Recently, Chambers et al. (1998) have introduced directional distance functions which can be viewed as additive (rather than multiplicative) measures efficiency. Directional distance functions are not restricted to non-negative input and output quantities; in addition, the traditional input and output-oriented measures are nested as special cases of directional distance functions. Consequently, directional distances provide greater flexibility. However, until now, only free disposal hull ({FDH}) estimators of directional distances (and their conditional and robust extensions) have known statistical properties (Simar and Vanhems, 2012). This paper develops the statistical properties of directional d estimators, which are especially useful when the production set is assumed convex. We first establish that the directional Data Envelopment Analysis ({DEA}) estimators share the known properties of the traditional radial {DEA} estimators. We then use these properties to develop consistent bootstrap procedures for statistical inference about directional distance, estimation of confidence intervals, and bias correction. The methods are illustrated in some empirical examples.},

The main point in order to validate the bootstrap is to define a reasonable data- generating process in this complex framework and to propose a reasonable estimator of it.
